# Tetris_SFML
Tetris implemented during 2016 holidays, using C++ and SFML engine.
The game is playable. However, Leaderboard section is not implemented and there are no sound effects.

All images are created by me (I used GIMP).

C++ programs and images are in Tetris directory.

Short description of programs:

- constants.h - There are constants, which are used in other files.
- game.h and game.cpp - These programs are responsible for starting the app (loading files, initializing object Game), displaying right section of app, and there is game loop.
- gameplay.h and gameplay.cpp - Main part of this project.
