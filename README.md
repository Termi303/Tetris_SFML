# Tetris_SFML
Tetris implemented during 2016 holidays, using C++ and SFML engine.
The game is playable. However, Leaderboard section is not implemented and there are no sound effects.

All images are created by me (I used GIMP).

C++ programs and images are in Tetris directory.

Short description of programs:
